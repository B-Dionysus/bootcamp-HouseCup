# House Cup Scoreboard

I liked the scoreboard that Dave designed (https://raptorcentauri.github.io/HouseCup-FrontEnd/) but it didn't sort the houses in order of score.

This version (https://b-dionysus.github.io/bootcamp-HouseCup/)

* Sorts based on score
* Displays team icons in pleasing pyramid shape
* Increases size of icons based on proximity to winning score
* Displays an enormous, ominous backdrop of the winning icon 

The backdrop looks ok with AOL, but in my oipinion it would look much nicer with the winAmp logo. (:

# Known Bugs / ToDo

* Sometimes it takes a while to load, so there should be a Comforting Message to let the user know something is happening (currently it's just a blank screen)
* Sometimes the trilogy server is down, so it would be nice to handle that gracefully
